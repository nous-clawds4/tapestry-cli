# Brainstorm NosFabrica Propagation Tests

Automated smoke tests to verify that nostr follow events propagate correctly
through the NosFabrica Brainstorm pipeline, measuring both correctness and latency.

## Pipeline Under Test

```
publish (relay.primal.net, relay.damus.io, nos.lol, purplepag.es, localhost:7777)
  └→ wot.grapevine.network          (gateway relay)
       ├→ neofry.nosfabrica.com      (production relay)
       │    └→ brainstormserver.nosfabrica.com  (production API / neo4j)
       └→ neofry-staging.nosfabrica.com         (staging relay)
            └→ brainstormserver-staging.nosfabrica.com  (staging API / neo4j)
```

Production and staging are **independent parallel branches** — both sync from the
gateway relay separately. They do not feed from each other.

## What It Does

1. **Baseline**: Queries Nous's current kind 3 (contact list) follow count from
   3 relays + 2 Brainstorm server APIs (5 endpoints total).
2. **Publish**: Creates a new kind 3 event adding one random follow (selected
   from Dave's follow list) and publishes to primal + damus.
3. **Initial check** (T+20s): Re-queries all 5 endpoints.
4. **Retry loop**: If any endpoint has **not** incremented, the script re-queries
   **all 5 endpoints** every 5 minutes. This continues until:
   - All testable endpoints have passed, **OR**
   - 1 hour has elapsed since the publish event.
   
   Every round queries all endpoints (including previously-passed ones) to
   document that no unexpected changes occur during the wait.
5. **Results**: Saves structured JSON with per-round snapshots to `results/`.

## Pass/Fail/N/A Logic

- Each stage depends on its **upstream** stage in the pipeline tree.
- If upstream **never passed** → downstream is **N/A** (untestable, because we
  can't distinguish "downstream is broken" from "data never arrived").
- **PASS** = follow count incremented by ≥1 compared to baseline.
- **FAIL** = did not increment within the 1-hour retry window.

Examples:
- Gateway fails → both relay branches = N/A → both API checks = N/A
- Gateway passes, prod relay passes, prod API fails → prod API = FAIL
  (data reached the relay but the API/neo4j didn't process it)
- Gateway passes, staging relay fails → staging API = N/A

## Brainstorm API Authentication

The `/user/{pubkey}` endpoint requires authentication. The flow:

1. `GET /authChallenge/{pubkey}` → returns `{ data: { challenge: "..." } }`
2. Sign a **kind 22242** nostr event with these tags:
   - `["t", "brainstorm_login"]`
   - `["challenge", "<challenge_string>"]`
   
   Content is empty string. Sign with Nous's nsec via `nak event --sec`.
3. `POST /authChallenge/{pubkey}/verify` with body `{ "signed_event": <event> }`
   → returns `{ data: { token: "..." } }`
4. Use the token as HTTP header: `access_token: <token>`

Token is valid for ~5 hours. The script authenticates once at the start
and reuses the token for all subsequent API queries.

## Prerequisites

- `nak` CLI (v0.18+)
- `jq`
- `curl`
- Nous's nsec accessible via **one** of:
  - `NOSTR_SECRET_KEY` environment variable (nsec or hex)
  - 1Password desktop app unlocked — script reads from:
    `op read "op://Personal/Nous - Nostr Key/password"`

## Usage

```bash
cd brainstorm-nosfabrica-tests
./run-test.sh
```

Or with explicit key:
```bash
NOSTR_SECRET_KEY=nsec1... ./run-test.sh
```

## Results Format

Results are saved to `results/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json`. Example:

  }
}
```

Key fields:
- `baseline` — follow counts before the publish event
- `rounds` — snapshot of all counts and verdicts at each check
- `final_verdicts` — the last round's verdicts (or FAIL if max time exceeded)
- `total_elapsed_seconds` — how long until all passed (or timeout)
- `total_rounds` — number of query rounds performed

## Timing Constants

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `INITIAL_WAIT` | 20s | Wait before first check after publish |
| `RETRY_INTERVAL` | 300s (5 min) | Wait between retry rounds |
| `MAX_ELAPSED` | 3600s (1 hour) | Maximum total time before giving up |

## Known Behaviors

- **Some relays may be unavailable** — the publish step sends to primal, damus,
  nos.lol, purplepag.es, and the local tapestry relay (localhost:7777). Only one
  needs to succeed for propagation to work.
- **Local relay (localhost:7777)** — the script publishes to the local tapestry
  strfry instance so the latest kind 3 is always available locally. This also
  ensures `get_latest_kind3` can always find a fresh copy.
- **purplepag.es** — a relay specifically for profile-related events (kinds 0, 3,
  10002), making it ideal for kind 3 distribution.
- **API counts may lag relay counts** — the Brainstorm server processes relay
  events into neo4j asynchronously. A lag of minutes is expected; the retry
  loop captures the actual latency.
- **Baseline mismatches** — if the API count is already behind the relay count
  at baseline, that indicates a pre-existing propagation issue. The test still
  measures whether the *new* follow propagates.

## Cleanup

Each test run adds one follow to Nous's contact list. Over many runs this will
grow. Cleanup (unfollowing test-added pubkeys) is handled separately and is
not part of this test script.
